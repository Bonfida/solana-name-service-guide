# Wallet Guide

This is the step-by-step guide to help wallet providers integrate .sol domain names and Twitter handles as a way to use them to send and receive funds instead of a pubkey.

The guide lays out the process of integrating domains to both Solana and the other blockchains SNS has been bridged to. Specifically, itâ€™ll aid you in understanding the nuanced aspects of resolving tokenized domains, those with record sections and subdomains.

The instructions are structured in a three-part layout:

7.1 [Resolving domains](/domain-name/wallet-guide/resolving-domains.md): describes how to integrate domains on Solana

7.2 [Resolving bridged domains](/domain-name/wallet-guide/bridged-domains.md): describes how to integrate domains on other chains

7.3 [Resolving Twitter handles](/domain-name/wallet-guide/twitter-handles.md): describes how to integrate Twitter handles linked to a pubkey
